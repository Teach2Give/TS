// Mocking is a testing technique where you replace parts of your application with simulated versions to control and isolate behavior during testing. This allows you to test how code interacts with external dependencies without relying on actual external systems, making it especially valuable when working with third-party services like payment processors.

// Here's why mocking is useful, particularly in cases like payment modules:

// Avoid Real Transactions: In a payment module, you don't want to run real transactions every time you test. Mocking lets you simulate responses from the payment processor (like success, failure, or network errors) without actually charging any real account.

// Control Over Test Conditions: With mocks, you can create specific scenarios, like simulating a declined card or a network failure, to see how your code handles them. This control helps you confirm that the app handles all possible outcomes correctly.

// Speed Up Testing: External APIs are often slower than in-memory mocks. Mocking external requests removes the dependency on network speed and service availability, making tests faster and more reliable.

// Test Isolation: By replacing real modules with mocks, tests become isolated and don't rely on external dependencies. This isolation ensures that your tests are focused on the logic of your application rather than the behavior of third-party services.

// Example of Mocking a Payment Module
// Suppose you have a function, processPayment, that calls a third-party payment API to handle charges. Here's how you might mock it to avoid real charges:

// payment.ts
export async function processPayment(amount: number, cardDetails: any) {
    // Imagine this calls a real API, and charges the card
    const response = await thirdPartyPaymentAPI.charge(amount, cardDetails);
    return response.status === 'success';
}

// In your test file, you would replace processPayment or the thirdPartyPaymentAPI.charge call with a mock:
import { processPayment } from './payment';

// Mock the third-party API call
jest.mock('./thirdPartyPaymentAPI', () => ({
    charge: jest.fn((amount, cardDetails) => {
        // Mock a successful response without actually charging anything
        return { status: 'success' };
    }),
}));

test('processPayment charges correctly', async () => {
    const result = await processPayment(100, { cardNumber: '1234' });
    expect(result).toBe(true);
});
